## My process
1- i built the mobile app version first , it was ordinary .
2- i moved to the larger versions , by maintaining the media queries .
3- i tested everything , i deployed the project .

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- placing elements without the need to flex-box " works sometimes of course " .
- more about media queries .

### Continued development

i will keep focusing on building literally any project with general clear steps .
whether it's front-end or back-end development .

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me with different problems throughout the development process .
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - Amazing website , explains nearly all the HTML/CSS properties .
